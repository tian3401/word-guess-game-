# Matt's Favorite Music Word-Guess-Game-
The Word Guess Game is a fun game that incorporates good beats with some a good, old fashion game like Hangman. 
The primary purpose for this game is to provide some entertainment and to help me practice using Javascript loops and functions. 

# Tech/Frameworks 

The technologies used are the standard trio, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

Bootstrap was also incorporated to help with the overall layout using it's grid system. 

# How to use?

This project can be used by new users of Javascript or anyone who needs some examples of application and functions and loops. 

# Credits
